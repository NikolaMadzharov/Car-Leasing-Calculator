TASK 1: Car-Leasing-Calculator
How did I approach the problem?
Understanding the Problem: I started by reading the problem carefully to understand the requirements and constraints.
Visualizing the Solution: I then visualized the solution in my head, considering various approaches to solving the problem.
Selecting the Best Approach: I selected the most efficient approach and began writing the code. During the process, I encountered small issues, but I managed to fix them (who runs code successfully on the first attempt, right?
).
How does the solution work?
HTML and CSS: I began by writing the HTML structure and applying CSS to style the calculator. This provided the basic layout and design of the interface.

Understanding the Formula: Next, I opened a leasing calculator to understand how the formula works. This step was crucial to ensure the calculations are accurate.

Using the DOM: I utilized the Document Object Model (DOM) to get the input values from the user and manipulate the DOM tree to enable dynamic updates.

Event Listeners: I added event listeners to HTML attributes to capture user interactions and change values dynamically. This allows the calculator to update in real-time as the user inputs data.

Performing Calculations: After capturing the input values, I performed the necessary calculations using the given formula to provide accurate results.
